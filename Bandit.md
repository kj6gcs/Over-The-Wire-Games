## Level 0:

#### Goal:

SSH into the bandit0 account at bandit.labs.overthewire.org on port 2220. Password is bandit0.

#### Level Notes:

The goal of this level was pretty straight forward: SSH into the specified account on the specified port. I had to look up how to SSH into a specific port (ssh followed by the "-p" and port number followed by the login information). Quick and to the point. Upon loggin in the user is provided with some basic information about the game and Over the Wire.

#### Solution:

COMMAND:
ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

PASSWORD:
bandit0
